README for dispatch
-------------------

Dispatch is a driver program for generating event-shapes distributions
with disent and disaster++. Its features include

. use of a single event to generate weights for distributions at
  several x and Q^2 values. When looking at several x,Q^2 bins this
  can lead to an order of magnitude speed improvement compared to,
  say, the default way of running DISASTER.

. simple interface for specifying a run through a card file and 
  command-line options

. Option of running with user-selected random-number sequence,
  restarting a run from where it left off and combining runs done with
  different random number sequences (using routines from the disresum
  package, https://cern.ch/gsalam/disresum/).


The distribution includes the disent and disaster++ programs themselves.
The disent program included here is a slightly modified version of the
official 0.1 release and notably includes the bug fix by Ignacio Borsa,
Daniel de Florian and Ivan Pedron, as documented in Appendix A of 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07354.

For installation and brief running instructions please see the file
INSTALL.

its use, are to be found at https://cern.ch/gsalam/dispatch/
