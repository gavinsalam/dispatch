Description of card file
------------------------


======================================================================
Command-line options common to both programs
--------------------------------------------

-rundef	filename.IN	
	Required option; it sets the card file to be read in.

-nev NEV   [10^6?]
	Number of events.

-ybj y_bjorken [0.001]
	the value to be chosen for y_bjorken (recall that multiple x
	and Q values are done for fixed ybjorken).

-tdfl filename.top  [gtopdraw.top]
	File to which output should be sent.

	If the file already exists then 

	a) if -iseq corresponds (see below) the initial seed
           is set to be the last seed of the preexisting file

        b) output is sent filenamexx.top where xx is smallest number
	   for which filenamexx.top does not exist.

-iseq n    [1]
        Sets the random number sequence to be used. For details, see
	the documentation of the cernlib random number generator that
	is being used, rm48.

-wf nev  [10^6 for DISENT]
	The maximum interval (in events) after which intermediate
	results should be written to the output file (whose name stays
	the same at each write). For small total numbers of events the
	interval between writes may be smaller.

	Note that for DISASTER++ the normalisation is correct only for
	the final write. Owing to technical complications intermediate
	writes generally have a normalisation which is off by a couple
	of percent --- if one wishes to use the information from an
	incomplete run one should renormalise by hand (the join-renorm
	program offers this option).

-muF muF/Q [1.0]
	Sets the default value for the ratio mu_F/Q. (NB mu_F/Q can
	also be set in the card file). 

	Note that muF/=1 is not yet supported for DISASTER++.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Options relevant only for disent
---------------------------------




-npow1 NPOW1 [2]
-npow2 NPOW2 [4]
        The values for the NPOW1 and NPOW2 internal disent parameters
	(see the DISENT documentation for details).

-cutoff [10^{-12}]
	Default value for the internal disent cutoff

-cf [1.333333333]
	The value of the C_F colour factor

-CA [3.0]
	The value of the C_A colour factor

-TR [0.5]
	The value of the T_R colour factor


-order ORDER [2]
        Whether to do a LO (ORDER=1) or a NLO (ORDER=2) calculation.
